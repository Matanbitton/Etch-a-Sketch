# Etch-a-Sketch
This "drawing board" project is a part of the Odin Project Curriculum.
The grid is made entirely from interactive div's,
the user can decide the color of the divs and change the size of the grid.

overall fun project! I learnt how to create as many divs as needed and give them different propreties based on the user's choice.
